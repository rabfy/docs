---

The Meta Pixel allows you to track your Rabfy store activity such as product views, adds to cart, purchases, and checkout events. This helps you analyze ad performance and retarget customers across Facebook and Instagram.

> **Before You Begin**\
> You’ll need:

- A Meta Business Suite account
- Access to Meta Events Manager

## Step 1: Create a Meta Pixel Dataset

1. Go to [Meta Events Manager](https://business.facebook.com/events_manager2/list)
2. Click **"Connect Data"** → Select **Web** → Click **Next**
3. Choose from existing datasets or create a new dataset
4. Name your Pixel (e.g., _Rabfy Store Pixel_)
5. Click **Continue** → Your Pixel will now be created

## Step 2: Copy Your Meta Pixel ID

After creation, copy your **Pixel ID (Dataset ID)** from the **Settings** section of your newly created dataset in event manager. You’ll need it for Rabfy integration.

## Step 3: Connect Meta Pixel to Rabfy

1. Log in to your [Rabfy Dashboard](https://dashboard.rabfy.com/)
2. Go to **Settings → Integrations**
3. Scroll to **Meta Pixel** section
4. Paste your **Pixel ID** (Dataset ID)
5. Toggle the **Enable Meta Pixel** switch
6. Click **Save Settings**

> Your Pixel is now active. Rabfy will send events such as:
>
> - Page View
> - View Content
> - Add to Cart
> - Initiate Checkout
> - Purchase

## What Happens Next?

Once your Meta Pixel is active:

- You can monitor user behavior inside Meta Events Manager
- You can run ads and optimize for conversions (i.e., purchases)
- You can retarget visitors and build custom audiences from your Pixel data
- You can also set server side tracking using [**Google Tag Manager**](https://docs.rabfy.com/integrations/google-tag-manager) integration

## Troubleshooting

**Events not showing in Meta?**

- Make sure Pixel ID is correct
- Allow up to 15 minutes for events to appear
- Use [Facebook Pixel Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-pixel-helper/fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc) Chrome Extension to debug
