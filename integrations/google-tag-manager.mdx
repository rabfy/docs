## Why Integrate Google Tag Manager?

Rabfy already supports direct integration of **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and **Meta Pixel**.\
If you only need one of these tools, you can integrate them individually using our simple GA4 or Meta Pixel setup guides.

However, if you want to:

- Manage **multiple tracking tools** (like GA4, Meta Pixel, Google Ads, or others)
- Use **server-side tracking**
- Add **marketing and remarketing tags** easily
- Control and update tags **without changing your Rabfy site code manually**

Then Google Tag Manager (GTM) is the right choice.

> GTM acts like a central hub. Instead of placing every tracking code manually, you just install GTM once; Then manage everything from your GTM dashboard.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Add GTM to Your Rabfy Store

### Step 1: Create a Google Tag Manager Account

1. Go to https://tagmanager.google.com
2. Click **Create Account**
3. Enter an account name (e.g., _Your Brand Name_)
4. Set **Country** to where you manage your business (e.g., _Bangladesh_)
5. Under **Container Setup**, enter a name (e.g., _Rabfy Store_)
6. Select **Target Platform** as **Web**
7. Click **Create** and accept the terms

### Step 2: Copy Your GTM Container ID

Once your container is created, you'll get a GTM ID in this format:

```
GTM-XXXXXXX
```

Youâ€™ll find this in the top-right of your workspace or under **Admin \> Container Settings**.

### Step 3: Add GTM Container ID to Rabfy

1. Go to your **Rabfy Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings \> Integrations**
3. Scroll to the **Google Tag Manager** section
4. Paste your GTM Container ID into the input box
5. Click **Enable Google Tag Manager**
6. Click **Save Settings**

Your Rabfy store is now connected to GTM.

## What Can You Do Next with GTM?

Once GTM is installed, you can add and control:

- Google Analytics (GA4)
- Meta Pixel
- Conversion tracking
- Remarketing tags
- Custom JavaScript events
- Server-side tag setups (for advanced users)

> You do not need to add GA4 or Meta Pixel separately in Rabfy if you are using GTM to manage them. Just install those tags inside your GTM dashboard.

## Final Notes

- You can combine all your marketing tools in one dashboard
- Any updates to tracking codes can now be done without editing Rabfy again
- If you are new to GTM, start by adding GA4 and Meta Pixel using GTM templates
