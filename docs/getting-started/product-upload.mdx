After setting up your Rabfy account and storefront, your next step is to add products to your store. This page guides you through the full process of preparing and publishing your first item.

## **Where Do You Get Product Designs?**

Your product begins with a design. Let us assume that you have conducted the required background research on your chosen store niche and have the product design idea. Then, if you already have the idea designed, you can upload it right away. If not, here are several easy ways to get started:

- **Design it yourself** using tools like Canva, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, or Photopea
- **Buy ready-made commercial-use assets** from websites like Creative Fabrica, Envato Elements, or Freepik (make sure you have proper licensing)
- **Hire a designer** through freelance platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, or local services
- **Use AI-generated tools** (coming soon to Rabfy) to create simple graphics or text-based designs

Make sure your design is saved in high resolution (PNG or JPG) and follows the design guideline shared for each product. Also make sure it complies with our copywriting policy. 

## \*\*Step-by-Step Guide \*\*

Once your design is ready, follow these simple steps to create and publish your first product:

1. **Log in** to your Rabfy seller dashboard
2. Navigate to **Catalog** from the main menu
3. Browse the available products (e.g., t-shirt, mug, tote bag) and select one
4. Click on the product to enter the **Product Editor Window**
5. **Upload your design file** by dragging and dropping or selecting it from your computer
6. Fill out your **product name**, edit the \*\*description \*\*as per your need, and \*\*set prices \*\*for each variant. 
7. Review all the information if it is okay or not. 
8. Click **Publish**. Your product will now be live in your storefront

You can repeat this process for every new product you want to offer.

## **Design Guidelines**

To make sure your products look sharp and professional, follow these design tips:

- Use **high-resolution files** (300 DPI recommended)
- Keep important elements inside the **safe zone**
- Avoid placing small text that may become unreadable when printed
- Follow the specific design guidelines shared for each product properly.
- Preview your design carefully on the mockup before publishing

## **Print Area Sizes**

Each product has a specific print area. For best results, use the suggested canvas size shown in the design guideline image. When in doubt, use Rabfy’s preview and alignment tools to adjust your layout. 

## **After Publishing**

Once your product is published:

- It will appear in your online store immediately
- Customers will be able to view, select, and purchase it
- You can go to the **Products** section in your dashboard to edit, duplicate, or delete it anytime
- Orders for this item will be automatically fulfilled by Rabfy when placed
