Once your Rabfy store is live and your product is published, the next goal is to get sales. This guide explains the core marketing flow on how your product reaches your customers, why they might choose to buy, and what builds trust along the way.

It is written for Rabfy sellers, many of whom are based in Bangladesh, while their target buyers are often in the USA and other international markets.

## **The Selling Funnel: How Customers Decide to Buy**

Your audience doesn’t buy right away. They go through a basic journey:

1. **They discover your product** through a post, message, or ad
2. **They feel interested or curious** maybe it’s useful, fun, or relatable
3. **They build trust** they check the page, your store, or social proof
4. **They decide to buy** once they feel confident in what they see

Your job as a seller is to support this journey. Keep your product pages clear, your store professional, and your communication simple.

## **Why Your Audience Will Buy**

Most buyers don’t care where the product comes from. They care about:

- **The design**: is it unique, funny, meaningful, or useful?
- **The vibe**: does the store look real, trustworthy, and easy to shop?
- **The offer**: is the price reasonable? Is there a discount or story behind it?

Make sure your store answers these questions just by looking at it:

- Your banner and logo look clean
- Product mockups are realistic
- Product descriptions are simple
- Your CTA (Buy Now / Shop Now) is clear

## **Where to Share and Promote (High-Level View)**

You can choose between two broad types of media to reach your audience.

### **Earned Media (Free)**

This is when you use your personal or brand presence to reach people. It includes your prepared:

- Social profiles
- Communities or groups you build or follow
- Individual messaging and network

This is a slow but steady way to build trust. People are more likely to buy when they see:

- Your presence is real
- The product solves a need or expresses a personality or touches customers emotion
- The store looks professional

### **Paid Media (Invest to Grow)**

You can also invest in reaching a new audience, especially in the USA. This includes:

- Running ads that show your product directly
- Boosting a post or video with your product
- Partnering with small influencers

In this model, **your product page becomes the salesperson**. So:

- Use clear pricing
- Use bold visuals
- Avoid cluttered or confusing language
- Make sure the checkout experience is smooth

If someone in the US clicks your ad or link, they will land on your Rabfy store. From there, the product, page design, and price must convince them to buy.

## **What Builds Trust in Your Store**

Whether you're promoting through your earned audience, an ad, or a post, buyers only convert if they feel confident. These elements help build that trust:

- Clean product mockups
- Simple descriptions without spelling mistakes
- A store that looks complete (logo, banner, description text)
- Consistent color theme
- Clear contact information

You don’t need dozens of products. Even one good product and a well-prepared store is enough to begin.

## **After the Sale: What Happens Next**

Once a customer places an order:

- The order shows up in your **Rabfy dashboard**
- Rabfy automatically handles **printing, packaging, and delivery**
- Rabfy also manages **customer support and returns**
- You can track your **earnings and order status** anytime

Your main job remains to **attract customers and build your brand presence**.

## **Final Thought**

Sales don’t happen by accident. They happen when you understand what people see, feel, and believe when they land on your store.

Start small. Promote with honesty. Learn from each interaction. Over time, your store will improve and so will your results.
