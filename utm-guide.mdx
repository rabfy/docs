UTM parameters help you track where your traffic and orders are coming from. This guide will show you how to use them in your Rabfy store, so you can measure the performance of your ads, promotions, or social campaigns.

## What is a UTM Parameter?

A UTM parameter is a short piece of text added to the end of your store or product link. It helps Rabfy identify how a visitor reached your site.

For example:

```
https://www.yourstore.com/product-name?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_content=image_ad
```

This tells Rabfy that the visitor came from a Facebook ad as part of your summer campaign.

## Why Use UTM Parameters?

Using UTM links helps you:

- Know which platform brings the most visitors
- See which campaign performs best
- Measure your ad return on investment (ROI)
- Compare results across channels like Facebook, Instagram, or email

Without UTM tracking, all traffic will look the same in your analytics — and you won’t know what’s working.

## How to Set Up UTM Links

Go to your ad or campaign platform and paste your store/product link.

Then, attach the UTM format like this:

```
?utm_source=SOURCE&utm_medium=MEDIUM&utm_campaign=CAMPAIGN&utm_campaign=CAMPAIGN
```

**Replace the capital words with your actual details:**

| Parameter         | What it means                         | Example           |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------ | :---------------- |
| utm_source        | The platform or site                  | facebook, google  |
| utm_medium        | The type of promotion                 | ad, post, email   |
| utm_campaign      | The campaign name                     | launch, bogo50    |
| utm_content (opt) | The specific ad or version (optional) | headline1, imageA |

## Example UTM Link

```
https://www.yourstore.com/t-shirt?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=launch&utm_content=video_ad_1
```

When someone clicks this link, Rabfy will track that visit in the **Analytics → UTM Source** report.

## Tips for Better Tracking

- Be consistent with naming (e.g., use `facebook` not `fb` for clarity)
- Use different campaign names for different promotions
- Shorten long UTM links with tools like Bitly if needed
- Always test your links before launching the ad
