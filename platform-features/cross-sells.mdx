Rabfy’s Cross-Sell Offers feature allows you to suggest relevant products to your customers as they browse your store. This feature helps you increase average order value (AOV) by offering smart product bundles or single add-on  recommendations at the right time.

You can choose which product(s) will trigger a cross-sell offer, and which product(s) will be shown in response. This system works well for upselling, bundling, and guiding users to explore more from your catalog.

## How Cross-Sell Offers Work

When a customer views a specific product (called a **Source Product**), your designated **Target Products** will be shown as additional recommendations. These could be complementary products, product upgrades, or simply items from the same category.

You can choose between two types of offers:

- **Bundle:** Show a group of products as a package suggestion.
- **Single** **Add-On:** Offer items as single add on products aside the main order.

## Steps to Create a Cross-Sell Offer

1. **Navigate to the Cross-Sells Menu**\
   Go to your Rabfy Dashboard → Offers → Cross-Sells\
   Click **Create new cross-sell offer**
2. **Enter Basic Information**
   - **Offer Name:** Write a clear name for your internal reference (e.g., “Tote Bag with Mug Combo”)
   - **Offer Type:** Select either _Bundle_ or _Single Add-On_
   - **Toggle the Status:** Use the switch to keep the offer active
3. **Set Your Source Product**\
   Under **Source Products**, select one or more items that, when viewed, should trigger this cross-sell offer.
4. **Choose Your Target Products**\
   Under **Target Products**, pick the items you want to recommend or bundle with the source.
5. **Save the Offer**\
   Click **Create Cross-Sell Offer** to activate it on your store.

## Example Use Cases

- When a user views a plain T-shirt, you can offer a matching mug or tote bag.
- When someone views a mug, you can offer a bundle with a tshirt or hoodie.
- For a best-selling item, recommend related but slower-moving products to increase exposure.

## Managing Your Offers

Once created, you’ll see all your cross-sell offers listed on the Cross-Sells dashboard. From here, you can:

- Edit or delete existing offers
- Toggle offers on or off

If you want to encourage larger purchases or introduce more of your product catalog to each buyer, cross-sell offers are a simple and powerful feature to use. Make sure your selections feel relevant and timely. Cause, smart pairing builds trust and boosts sales.
