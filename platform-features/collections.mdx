The **Collections** feature in Rabfy lets you group related products into categories. These collections help your customers navigate your store more easily, discover similar products, and improve the overall shopping experience.

For example, you can create collections like "Best Sellers", "Winter Mugs", or "Tote Bags under \$15".

### Where to Find It

- Go to your **Rabfy Dashboard**
- Click on **Products** → **Collections**

If you haven't created any collections yet, you'll see a message prompting you to create your first one.

### How to Create a New Collection

1. Click on **Create new collection** (orange button on the top right)
2. In the **Basic Information** section:
   - **Collection Name**: Enter the name you want (e.g., “Hoodies”)
   - **Slug**: A URL-friendly version auto-filled based on the name (you can edit it)
   - **Description** (optional): You can write a short description of the products in this collection
3. **Show in Storefront**: Turn this on to make the collection visible to your customers
4. **Match All Rules**:
   - Turn this ON if you want products to be included **only when they match all rules**
   - Turn this OFF if products can be included when they match **any of the rules**

### Add Rules to Automatically Include Products

You can set **Collection Rules** to automatically include products that match certain criteria.

Example:

- **Column**: Product Tags
- **Condition**: Equals
- **Value**: hoodie

This means any product tagged with “hoodie” will be added to this collection.

Click **Add Rule** to include more filters if needed.

### Final Step

Once you’ve set everything, click the **Create Collection** button. Your new collection will now appear under **Products → Collections** and on your storefront (if visibility is enabled).
