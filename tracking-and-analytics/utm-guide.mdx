UTM parameters help you track where your traffic and orders are coming from. This guide will show you how to use them in your Rabfy store, so you can measure the performance of your ads, promotions, or social campaigns.

## What is a UTM Parameter?

A UTM parameter is a short piece of text added to the end of your store or product link. It helps Rabfy identify how a visitor reached your site.

For example:

```
https://www.yourstore.com/product-name?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_content=image_ad
```

This link shows Rabfy that the visitor arrived from a Facebook image ad in your Summer Sale campaign. Rabfy can then trace the visitor’s next steps inside your store such as pages viewed or items purchased etc.

## Why Use UTM Parameters?

Using UTM links helps you:

- Know which platform brings the most visitors
- See which campaign performs best
- Measure your ad return on investment (ROI) properly
- Compare results across channels like Facebook, Instagram, or email

Without UTM tracking, all traffic will look the same in your analytics and you won’t know what’s working.

## How to Set Up UTM Links

- Open your ad platform (for example, Meta Ads).
- In the **URL Parameters** field, paste this string:

```
?utm_source={{site_source_name}}&utm_medium={{adset.name}}&utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}&utm_content={{ad.name}}
```

- Publish the ad.

### What each tag means

| Parameter    | What it means                            | Example             |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------ |
| utm_source   | The platform or site or the source       | facebook, instagram |
| utm_medium   | The type of promotion or your adset name | fb_ppc_ad           |
| utm_campaign | The campaign name                        | summer, flash_sale  |
| utm_content  | The specific ad or creative version      | video1, imageA      |

### Creating custom links

You can build your own UTM links for any free or paid channel. Just edit the four tags above, share the link with your audience, and Rabfy will report results under **Analytics → UTM Source/Medium/Campaign/Content**.

## Example UTM Link

```
https://www.yourstore.com/t-shirt?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=launch&utm_content=video_ad_1
```

## Tracking UTM Results in Rabfy

1. Go to your **Rabfy Dashboard**
2. Click **Analytics** from the left menu
3. Choose **Report By**: UTM Source, Medium, Campaign, or Content
4. Select a time range (e.g., Last 7 days)
5. View how each link performed:
   - Total visits
   - Add to cart
   - Reached checkout
   - Orders and conversion rate
   - Profit per UTM source

## Tips for Better Tracking

- Be consistent with naming (e.g., use `facebook` not `fb` for clarity)
- Use different campaign names for different promotions
- Always test your links before launching the ad
